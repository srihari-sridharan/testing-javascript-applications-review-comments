# Testing JavaScript Applications

> **Note:** The below tests were executed and verified.
> Shall we consider running `npm audit fix` across chapters?

**General observation** - For some listings I don't see listing number and it is just the filename. I am OK as long as it is intended and conscious move! In some cases I found listings to have only one line of code change. So thought of checking with you on this. :-)

> Request to run `npm audit fix` across the codebase!
> There are pointers to GitHub repository and folders in the text. Will it help readers if we exactly point out where a code listing lives in GitHub?

## Chapter 6: Testing front-end applications

### Listing 6. 2. main.js

No comments.

> **Trivial suggestion!** In page 6 - the text reads as - "First, create a package.json file with `npm init -y` and then install JSDOM with `npm install jsdom`." Shall we update the command to have `--save`? While your GitHub sample has the package listed, this is for those who might create the new package as they read the book.

### Listing 6. 3. page.js

No comments.

### Listing 6. 4. example.js

No comments. Ran `node example.js.` - works as expected.

### Listing 6. 5. example.js

> **Update Jest Version:** Note in page 9 states that "At the time of this writing, Jestâ€™s current version is 24.9.". At the time of this review the version is 26.6.1. Request you to update this if needed, as 2 major versions have been released. This is something that is native to JavaScript libraries and frameworks as new versions get released at rapid pace! :-)
