### Suggestion

I feel the below text next to `Listing 8.11` can be emphasized.

> _When you have too many tests which depend on a single point of failure, centralize that point of failure into a single piece that you will use throughout your tests._

### Suggestion reg snapshot files

Shall we consider highlighting the below text in page 32?

> Once you’re done developing your component, if you’re using a version control system like `git`, make sure to include snapshots in your commits.

I am happy to see that you covered all the important aspects surrounding snapshot tests! Looking forward to read chapter 13 on handling code reviews.

My team used to conduct team code reviews (with 4 core members) to review snapshots so that we don't miss anything before committing them to source control after updates.

### Suggestion - Item addition

The application allows adding an empty item `{"itemAdded":"","addedQuantity":0}`, should we consider demonstrating validation and relevant tests ?
