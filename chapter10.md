## Chapter 10: UI-based end-to-end testing

### Page 2 - the text reads as

"The third and last section contains an overview of end-to-end testing tools. In it, I will present and compare tools like Selenium, Puppeteer, and Cypress, which is the tool I’ll use throughout the rest of this chapter."

Should the text end as "throughout next chapter" ?

### Page 6 - Note

> NOTE: I’ll go into detail about why these tests can be time-consuming to write and maintain on the sections "best practices for end-to-end tests" and "dealing with flakiness".

**These two sections ("best practices for end-to-end tests" and "dealing with flakiness") are part of chapter 11 and not 10. Do we need a correction here?**

### Page 8

In page 8 there is a cross reference to chapter 4 and chapter 6. I am confident that you would have taken care of this, request you to please review that chapter numbers are correct. I learnt from the git version history about splitting and joining chapters. Thanks.

### Page 11

The text reads as:

"For reasons I will explain throughout this entire chapter, especially within this section, Cypress is my personal favorite, and, therefore, the tool I’ve chosen to use to write almost all of the **upcoming examples**, and the tool into which I’ll focus in this section."

Instead of ~~"upcoming examples"~~ shall we state it as **"examples in the upcoming chapter"** ?

### Page 22

The text states - "Therefore, it is the tool I’ve chosen to use for the examples in ~~this chapter.~~" - can be changed to **"the next chapter."**
